Node.js Error Handling
Proper error handling is critical for building robust and reliable Node.js applications. Node.js provides a number of mechanisms for handling errors, including the try...catch block, event emitters, and custom error handling classes.

Types of Errors in Node.js:
System Errors: Errors that occur at the system level, such as file system or network errors.

Operational Errors: Errors that occur as a result of incorrect user input or data handling.

Programming Errors: Errors caused by mistakes in the code (e.g., undefined variables or functions).

Example Code: Using try...catch for Error Handling
try {
  let result = someUndefinedFunction();
} catch (error) {
  console.error('An error occurred:', error.message);
}

Best Practices:
Always handle asynchronous errors with .catch() or try...catch for async/await.

Use custom error classes to categorize different error types.

Log errors properly using libraries like winston or log4js for better monitoring.
