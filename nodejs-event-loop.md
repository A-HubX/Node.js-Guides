# Node.js Event Loop

Node.js operates on a single-threaded event loop. This loop allows Node.js to handle many connections concurrently without blocking the thread. Here's an overview:

## Phases of the Event Loop:
1. **Timers**: Executes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()`.
2. **I/O Callbacks**: Executes callbacks for I/O operations like network requests or file reads.
3. **Idle, Prepare**: Internal phase to prepare the next phase.
4. **Poll**: Retrieves new I/O events (e.g., reading from file system or network).
5. **Check**: Executes `setImmediate()` callbacks.
6. **Close Callbacks**: Executes callbacks like `close()` for processes that have been closed.

## Why is Event Loop Important?
The event loop allows Node.js to handle a large number of requests efficiently. Itâ€™s especially useful for I/O-bound operations such as database queries, network requests, and file reads.

## Best Practices:
- Avoid blocking the event loop with synchronous functions.
- Use asynchronous functions to handle I/O operations.
- For CPU-bound tasks, consider using worker threads or offloading to external services.
